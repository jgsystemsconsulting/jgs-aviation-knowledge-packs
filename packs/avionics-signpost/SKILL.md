description: "Signpost (not a knowledge pack) for the avionics development assurance standards landscape: RTCA DO-178C / EUROCAE ED-12C and its supplements (DO-330/ED-215, DO-331/ED-218, DO-332/ED-217, DO-333/ED-216); RTCA DO-254 / EUROCAE ED-80; SAE ARP4754B and ARP4761A; and the free regulator documents that recognise them (FAA AC 20-115D, AC 20-152A, Order 8110.49A; EASA AMC 20-115D and AMC 20-152A). Contains no source content: each row carries only the designation, title, edition, owner, redistributability status, and the owner's URL. Use when you need to identify, cite, or locate an avionics standard; paywalled rows point to the owner, free rows point to the regulator text or the in-repo faa-8110-49 or easa-rules pack."

# Avionics Development Assurance Standards: Signpost (pointers only)

**This is a signpost, not a knowledge pack.** It carries **no standards-body content**:
no reproduced clauses, no normative text, no synthesised summaries of the standards.
DO-178C, DO-254, and the SAE ARPs are paywalled with no redistribution grant (Excluded
under this repo's `docs/SOURCE-VETTING.md`), so they cannot be reconstituted into a
redistributable pack. What this skill does: tell you which document you want, what it is
for, who owns it, whether a free copy exists, and where to get the authentic one.

## When to use

You are developing or reviewing avionics software or airborne electronic hardware and
need to identify or cite the governing document: which standard covers tool
qualification, which AC recognises DO-254, which EASA text accepts DO-178C. Paywalled
rows route you to the owner; free regulator rows route you to the authentic text or,
where this repo ships one, to the installable pack.

**Prerequisites:** none, plain Markdown.

## How to use

Find your document below. The **Status** column says whether it can be packaged:

- **Excluded**: paywalled, no redistribution grant; buy from the owner. *Cannot* be packaged here.
- **Open**: free to obtain; where this repo ships a pack for it, the row names it (`pack: faa-8110-49`).

Editions for the RTCA, EUROCAE, and FAA rows were confirmed from the FAA recognition
texts and the EASA Easy Access Rules page. The SAE rows state the edition letter only
because the SAE catalogue pages did not confirm a publication date; do not quote one
from here.

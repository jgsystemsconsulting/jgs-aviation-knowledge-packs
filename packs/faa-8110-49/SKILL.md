# FAA Airborne Software and Hardware Approval Guidance (Order 8110.49A, AC 20-115D, AC 20-152A)
**Source**: U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (AIR), 3-source reference set: Order 8110.49A (2018-03-29), AC 20-115D (2017-07-21), AC 20-152A (2022-10-07); pinned 2026-09-25 | **Licence**: Public Domain (US Government work, 17 U.S.C. 105) | **Chapters**: 10

## When to use

**Prerequisites:** none, plain Markdown; no MCP server, API key, or licence tier needed at runtime.

Use this skill for questions about how the FAA reviews and approves the software and airborne electronic hardware sides of a certification project: how a software review is planned and what its objectives are, how much FAA involvement a project should expect and how the worksheets score it, what a software conformity inspection covers and when Form 8120-10 is used, what AC 20-115D recognizes and how DO-178B-era processes carry forward, and what AC 20-152A requires for custom devices, COTS IP, COTS devices, and circuit board assemblies. The pack answers with the FAA's own frameworks, cited by chapter and source row.

## How to Use This Skill

- **Without arguments**: read the Core Frameworks below for the review process, the level-of-involvement logic, conformity inspection, and the recognition chain from FAA guidance to the RTCA/EUROCAE standards.
- **With a topic**: use the Topic Index to find the chapter, then ask directly (e.g. "which LOI worksheet applies at software level B", "does this COTS IP block need AC 20-152A objectives").
- **With a chapter**: ch01 orientation (which document answers which question); ch02-ch04 the FAA review, involvement, and conformity machinery of Order 8110.49A; ch05-ch06 AC 20-115D software development assurance and legacy software; ch07-ch10 AC 20-152A airborne electronic hardware.

## Core Frameworks & Mental Models

### The recognition chain: how FAA guidance points at industry standards
The FAA does not write avionics development standards; it recognizes them. **Advisory Circulars are the recognition instrument**: AC 20-115D recognizes EUROCAE ED-12C / RTCA DO-178C for airborne software, together with the supplement set (DO-330 tool qualification, DO-331 model-based development, DO-332 object-oriented technology, DO-333 formal methods, with EUROCAE ED-215 to ED-218 as equivalents), and cancels AC 20-115C. AC 20-152A recognizes ED-80 / DO-254 for airborne electronic hardware, cancels AC 20-152, and layers FAA-specific objectives on top for custom devices, COTS IP, COTS devices, and circuit board assemblies. **Order 8110.49A is the internal instruction to FAA staff**: how AIR offices and designees apply DO-178B/C when working certification projects (TC, STC, ATC, ASTC, TSOA). The mental model for reading any question: first decide whether it is about what the standard demands (paywalled, out of this pack) or about what the FAA does with it (in this pack). References to DO-178C in the order include its supplements and DO-330 as applicable.

### The software review process (Order 8110.49A, Ch 2)
The **certification liaison process** (DO-178B/C Section 9) is the vehicle for communication between applicant and authority, and the authority may review software life cycle processes and data to assess compliance (Sections 9.2 and 10.3). Reviews run **desk or on-site**; on-site buys access to software personnel, automation, and test setup, and both forms can be delegated to authorized designees. On-site reviews stand on nine practical arrangements agreed with the developer: scope, dates and locations, authority personnel, designees, agendas and expectations, data to be made available before and at the review, procedures, resources, and how results (including corrective actions) will be communicated. The review process serves four objectives: timely technical interpretation of the certification basis and applicable objectives; visibility into implementation compliance and data; objective evidence that the software adheres to its approved plans; and the chance to monitor designee work.

### Level of FAA involvement (Order 8110.49A, App A, criteria also in Ch 2)
Involvement is sized early, documented, and proportional: more scrutiny where risk and novelty are higher, less where experience is deep. Eight factors drive it: software level from the system safety assessment; product attributes (size, complexity, functionality, novelty, design); new technologies or unusual design features; novel software methods or life cycle models; the applicant's track record with DO-178B/C objectives; designee availability and experience; DO-178B/C Section 12 issues; and software issue papers. **Appendix A carries three worksheets**, examples not mandates: Worksheet 1 maps software level to involvement (D = LOW; C = LOW or MEDIUM; B and A = MEDIUM or HIGH); Worksheet 2 scores experience and demonstrated capability on 0-to-max scales (certification experience, DO-178B/C experience, older-standard experience, other standards, ability to consistently produce compliant software); Worksheet 3 converts the Worksheet 2 total into an involvement level. The mental model: involvement is a dial, not a gate; the worksheets justify where it is set.

### Software conformity inspection (Order 8110.49A, Ch 4)
Conformity confirms the article matches the approved type design (14 CFR 21.33(b)). For software, type design is at minimum the DO-178B Section 9.4 data: Software Requirements Data, Design Description, Source Code, Executable Object Code, the Software Configuration Index, and the Software Accomplishment Summary. Continuous compliance is assessed through **ASE (Aviation Safety Engineer) or authorized DER reviews** across the life cycle; conformity inspection adds two documented checkpoints before TC/STC/ATC/ASTC/TSOA issuance, at **test acceptance** and **installation**. **Software part conformity** covers each test flown or run for certification credit: the ASE establishes the baseline (by review, or by a DER's Form 8110-3 stating the baseline is approved for FAA testing), checks the test configuration against the test baseline, verifies artifacts are identified and controlled, confirms tool qualification status, and raises **FAA Form 8120-10, Request for Conformity**, so MIDO/MISO staff (ASI) can witness and verify. Special-purpose test software used for environmental qualification is verified, validated, and configured as part of the test setup. **Installation conformity** then verifies the as-installed software matches the approved configuration.

### DO-178B to DO-178C transition (AC 20-115D)
AC 20-115D recognizes ED-12C/DO-178C and describes the standard's method: objectives for life cycle processes, activities that satisfy them, and evidence showing satisfaction. It also defines a **transition path**: applicants with established ED-12B/DO-178B processes may keep using them (including tool qualification processes) for new development where the processes show no known process deficiencies (audits, reviews, open problem reports), were used on a certified product at an equal or higher software level, and, where model-based development, object-oriented technology, or formal methods are involved, were previously found acceptable by the FAA. **Parameter Data Item** configuration data has its own criteria. Life cycle data is submitted to the extent needed to satisfy the applicable objectives, and tool qualification moves to **DO-330** (which supersedes the DO-178B section 12.2 approach, with transition guidance the AC summarizes). Section 8 to 9 material covers **supplement use, field-loadable software (FLS), user-modifiable software (UMS)**, and a legacy software modification flow chart for previously certified software.

### Airborne electronic hardware: custom devices and the AC 20-152A additions (S3)
AC 20-152A applies DO-254/ED-80 to **custom devices** and splits them by classification. A **complex custom device** (one whose failure cannot be shown sufficiently by testing alone, in ED-80/DO-254 terms) takes the full standard: ED-80/DO-254 is recognized as the industry standard for its development assurance, plus the AC's additional objectives and clarifications in its sections 5.5 to 5.11. A **simple custom device** can take significantly reduced life cycle data, but two things do not shrink: it must perform its intended function and stay under configuration management, so it can be reproduced, conformed, and analyzed for continued operational safety. The AC then extends the same objective-based style to **verification** (robustness, a stated HDL code coverage method), **tool assessment and qualification**, **previously developed hardware**, **COTS intellectual property** (provider assessment, planning, verification, Appendix B considerations), **COTS devices**, and **circuit board assemblies (CBA)**. Single event effects are explicitly out of the AC's scope. The recognition chain closes the loop: hardware questions route through AC 20-152A exactly as software questions route through AC 20-115D.

## Scope & Limits

- **FAA scope only.** This pack restates US FAA guidance: Order 8110.49A and ACs 20-115D/20-152A. It carries no RTCA DO-178C or DO-254, EUROCAE ED-12C or ED-80, supplement (DO-330 to DO-333, ED-215 to ED-218), or SAE ARP4754B/ARP4761A text; those standards are copyrighted and are named only. For designations, editions, and where to buy, use the avionics-signpost pack.
- **No standard internals.** Software-level objective tables (levels A to E), DO-178C annex tables, and DO-254 process details live in the paywalled standards; this pack covers what the FAA documents themselves say about applying them.
- **EASA not covered.** AMC 20-115D and AMC 20-152A are outside this pack; easa-rules is the pack that answers EASA software and AEH means-of-compliance questions.
- **Guidance is not regulation.** ACs describe an acceptable means, not the only means, and do not bind the public; orders bind FAA staff, not applicants. Nothing here is legal advice or a substitute for the source documents or your certification authority.
- **Dates are pinned.** The source set was pinned 2026-09-25 with documents dated 2017-07-21 to 2022-10-07. Later FAA actions, policy changes, and new or revised ACs are out of scope; check the FAA website for current versions before relying on a single requirement.
